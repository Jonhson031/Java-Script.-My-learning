# JavaScript Learning & Practice Repository 🚀

This repository contains my JavaScript learning notes, code examples, and practice projects.
It documents my progress from JavaScript fundamentals to advanced concepts, modern syntax, and real-world applications.

I have fully completed the **Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann**, which this repository closely follows and expands upon with practice projects.

The goal of this repository is to build a strong JavaScript foundation, understand how JavaScript works behind the scenes, and apply concepts through hands-on projects.

### ✅ JavaScript Basics
- Variables & data types
- Arrays

---

### ✅ Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Destructuring (objects & arrays)
- Spread & rest operators
- Short-circuiting (`&&`, `||`, `??`)
- Optional chaining
- Sets
- Maps
- All major array methods:
  - `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
  - `find`, `some`, `every`
  - `sort`, `flat`, `flatMap`
  - `slice`, `splice`, `concat`

### ✅ Functions (In Depth)
- Default parameters
- Higher-order functions
- Closures
- `call`, `apply`, `bind`
- Callback functions
- First-class & pure functions

### ✅ Asynchronous JavaScript
- Call stack & event loop
- Web APIs
- Microtasks vs macrotasks
- Callbacks & callback hell
- Promises
- Async / Await
- Error handling (`try/catch`)
- Promise combinators:
  - `Promise.all`
  - `Promise.race`
  - `Promise.allSettled`
  - `Promise.any`

### ✅ Working with APIs
- Fetch API
- AJAX & JSON
- REST APIs
- Handling API errors
- Running promises in parallel

---

### ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Constructor functions and the `new` operator
- Prototypes and the prototype chain
- Prototypal inheritance
- Inheritance between “classes” (ES5 & ES6)
- Prototypal inheritance on built-in objects
- `Object.create()` pattern
- ES6 classes
